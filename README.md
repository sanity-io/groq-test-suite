# GROQ test suite

The GROQ test suite is the official conformance test suite for the [GROQ specification](https://github.com/sanity-io/GROQ).

## Status

The test suite (and the specification) was started in August 2019 and is nearly empty, but under active development.
Currently we're working on moving over tests from the internal GROQ implementation used in [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

## Structure

The test suite is written in YAML files in the `test/` directory. Here's an example file:

```yaml
documents:
  - _id: "a"
    _type: "person"
    name: "George Michael Bluth"
  - _id: "b"
    _type: "company"
    name: "Bluth Inc."
    manager:
      _ref: "a"

tests:
  - name: "Resolve references"
    query: |
      *[_type == "company"][].manager->name
    result:
      - "George Michael Bluth"
```

### Nesting tests

Tests can be nested and will then inherit properties from their parent.

Here's a slightly contrived example which shows how the dataset can be overriden for a specific test case:

```yaml
# This test file:
documents:
  - _id: "a"
  - _id: "b"

tests:
  name: "Counting"
  query: |
    count(*)
  result: 2

  tests:
    - documents:
        - _id: "a"
        - _id: "b"
        - _id: "c"
      result: 3

# â€¦ would be equivalent to:
tests:
  - name: "Counting"
    documents:
      - _id: "a"
      - _id: "b"
    query: |
      count(*)
    result: 2

  - name: "Counting 2"
    documents:
      - _id: "a"
      - _id: "b"
      - _id: "c"
    query: |
      count(*)
    result: 3
```

### Variables

Queries can use the syntax `${name}` for refering to variables.
Together with test inheritance this can be used to succinctly test many different cases.

```yaml
documents:
  - _id: "a"
  - _id: "b"
  - _id: "c"

tests:
  - name: "Filtering"
    query: |
      count(*[${filter}])
    tests:
      - result: 1
        variables:
          filter: '_id == "a"'
      - result: 2
        variables:
          filter: '_id >= "b"'
```

### Specifying datasets

Tests can either declare datasets inline (using the `documents` property) or refer to an external dataset by name:

```yaml
dataset: movies
tests:
  - name: "Good movies"
    query: |
      count(*[_type == "movive" && rating > 8.0])
    result: 123
```

Currently the following named datasets are available:

| Name | Size | Documentation | URL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `movies` | ~500k documents (~200MB) | [./utils/the-movies-dataset](./utils/the-movies-dataset) | [ðŸ”—](https://groq-test-suite.storage.googleapis.com/datasets/movies/movies-f6fd5605328d7e1d6c667addc455aff2.ndjson) |

### Schema

The full schema is as follows:

```typescript
// Every test file contains a single "test"
type TestFile = Test

type Test = {
  dataset?: string
  documents?: Array<any>

  name?: string

  query?: string
  variables?: Variables

  tests?: Array<Test>
}

type Variables = { [key: string]: string }
```

### Compiling the test suite

The YAML files are optimized for writing tests.
If you're planning to consume the test suite it's recommended to use the *compiled* test suite:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Build the test suite
$ yarn build > test.ndjson
```

The compiled test suite is a [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) file where every entry uses the following schema:

```typescript
type Entry = Dataset | Test

type Dataset = {
  _type: "dataset"
  _id: string

  documents?: Array<any>
  url: string
}

type Test = {
  _type: "test"
  _id: string

  name: string
  filename: string
  query: string
  result: string
  dataset: {
    _ref: string
  }
}
```
